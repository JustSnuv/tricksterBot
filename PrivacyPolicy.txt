Trickster Privacy Policy

1. Information We Collect
Trickster collects minimal information to provide its services, including your Discord user ID and in-game activity (e.g., Candy, Cookies, gameplay stats). No personal information like email or real-world identity is collected unless you voluntarily provide it.

2. How We Use Information
- To operate and improve the botâ€™s features (game stats, leaderboards, rewards).
- To prevent abuse, cheating, or fraud.
- To communicate important updates or maintenance notices.

3. Data Sharing
Trickster does not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except where required by law or Discord compliance.

4. Data Storage & Retention
All collected data is stored securely in our databases. We retain your data for as long as you use the bot or until you request deletion.

5. Your Rights
You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting the developers. Note that deleted data is permanent and cannot be restored.

6. Security
We implement standard measures to protect your data. However, no system is 100% secure, and we are not liable for breaches outside of our control.

7. Third-Party Services
Trickster may use third-party libraries or APIs (like Discord) to function. These services have their own privacy policies.

8. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Users will be notified via the bot or changelogs. Continued use of Trickster constitutes acceptance of changes.
